December 3, 2023, Dup

- Added a "view shoping cart" option on home page (index.jsp)

Product.jsp 
-added product description

showcart.jsp
-added remove item functionality (includes removecart file)

Dec 5
- added remove item option on admin page(inckudes removeproduct and removeproductform files)
- added "back to home page" button cart page
- made some changes to order.jsp, changged the logic a bit and some variable names so that checkout works correctly


Dec6
-Changed flow of informaton. Instead of checkout -> order.jsp its now checkout -> confirmCheckout (to check if password and username
are correct) - > payment -> process_payments (to add new crditCard info the database) -> order.
-Instead, order just adds the information to orderSummaryt instead of verifying the password/username

-added back buttons for error messages on checkout 
-wrong name, wrong password, empty cart

-also added back button when errors occur on inputting credit card information 

-added a show all customers button on admin page(and listcustomers file to do it )

-added account creation page createaccount.jsp. Redirects to creataccountprocess.jsp. There , it loads it 
into the database. If its successful, then it sends you to accountconfirmation.jsp file to tell you it wokred. 

-lastly, i've tried to make a way to create a new account, which includes the files createaccount, createaccountprocess, and accountconfirmation 
However, there is an issue: when I try to make a new account, it redirects me to the login.jsp page saying 
"You have not been authorized to access the URL http://localhost/shop/createaccountprocess.jsp" So, its not allowing you to go from index -> createaccount -> creataccountprocess
This seems to be due to the auth page, and the error message is to not being authenticated. Let me know if you have a fix for this.
